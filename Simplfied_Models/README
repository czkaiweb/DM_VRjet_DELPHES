Attached models are models for CalcHEP

/Simplified_Models/models includes two simplified models,

Model 15: New scalar resonance Y  with new fermion coupling with Y, Higgs and neutrino
Model 16: New scalar resonance Y, new fermion coupling with Y, Higgs and new DM particle (fermion)

To generate events in batch mode, new models should be added with ./calchep manually.
