In this package, CalcHEP is used as parton level generator.

To setup CalcHEP, 
	run ./SetupCalcHEP $EventName $BatchName
A working area ./$EventName would be created, a batch file from calchep_script/batch will be added into working area for parameter scan.


Existed batch files include:
 a. batch_YsFfwDM_hhmet_scan: A new scalar, a new fermion, DM particle(fermion), Dihiggs(4b) production with MET
    Model:Ys-Ff-DM-s-channel
    MDM(mass of dark matter particle) should be set, 1GeV as default
    When gYqq fixed, scanning over:
	gYgg, MY, MF
    When gYgg fixed, scanning over:
	gYqq, MY, MF
 
 b. batch_YsFfnu_hhmet_scan: A new scalar, a new fermion, Dihiggs(4b) production with MET

    Model:Ys-Ff-DM-s-channel
    MDM(mass of dark matter particle) should be set, 1GeV as default
    When gYqq fixed, scanning over:
        gYgg, MY, MF
    When gYgg fixed, scanning over:
        gYqq, MY, MF

 c.batch_YsFfnu_dijet_scan: dijet (SM quark pair) production in model with Y F
    Model:Ys-Ff-nu-s-channel
    Process: p,p -> Y -> j,j
    p = u,U,d,D,G
    j = u,U,d,D,G,s,S,c,C,b,B

After generating, Storedata.sh will help to trasnfer Event files and cross-section numerical results in ./data folder.
