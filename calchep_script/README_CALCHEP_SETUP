In this package, CalcHEP is used as parton level generator.

To setup CalcHEP, 
	run ./SetupCalcHEP $EventName $BatchName
A working area ./$EventName would be created, a batch file from calchep_script/batch will be added into working area for parameter scan.

Existed batch files include:
 a. batch_YsFswDM_hhmet_scan: A new scalar, a new fermion, DM particle(fermion), Dihiggs(4b) production with MET
    Model:Ys-Ff-DM-s-channel
    MDM(mass of dark matter particle) should be set, 1GeV as default
    When gYqq fixed, scanning over:
	gYgg, MY, MF
    When gYgg fixed, scanning over:
	gYqq, MY, MF
