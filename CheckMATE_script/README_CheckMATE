CheckMATE is applied to make fast detector simulation thread with PYTHIA and DELPHES.

In ./Delphes, some scripts help to produce python scripts for running delphes simulation

   pre_run.py:
	dataname: gYgg/gYqq (select the scanning mode)
	Setup scanning parameter in event generation
	MY_l,MY_l,gYqq_l,gYgg_l
   	
	run_script contains all scripts produced.
   

   prepare_delphes.py: 
	$NAME need be modified according to name of LHE files
	
   
In ./detector_configure
	A sample ATLAS 13TeV delphes card is applied.
	Modification for delphes card can be done in $AnalysisWorking/CheckMATE_script/detector_configure
	Use SetupDelphesCard to replace orignal version in CheckMATE
	Original cards will be stored in $CHECKMATE_PATH/data/cards_original
