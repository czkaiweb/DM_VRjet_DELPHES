CheckMATE is applied to make fast detector simulation thread with PYTHIA and DELPHES.

Once one has LHE file as parton level events:

	Step1. Setup the name of events in Delphes/prepare_delphes.py
	Step2. Setup scanning parameter points of LHE data
	Step3. run 
		$python pre_run.py gYgg
	       or 
		$python pre_run.py gYqq
	       to generate scripts for CheckMATE
	Step4.(optinal)
		update the detector_cards for detector simualtion
	Step5. run
		$./runlocal.sh gYgg (gYqq)


In ./Delphes, some scripts help to produce python scripts for running delphes simulation

   pre_run.py:
	dataname: gYgg/gYqq (select the scanning mode)
	Setup scanning parameter in event generation
	MY_l,MY_l,gYqq_l,gYgg_l
   	
	run_script contains all scripts produced.
   

   prepare_delphes.py: 
	$NAME need be modified according to name of LHE files
	
   
In ./Delphes/detector_cards, one can prepare the detector configuration
	A sample ATLAS 13TeV delphes card is applied.
	Modification for detector card can be done here. To store one's own detector cards, Delphes/detector_cards/my_cards will help



Before using CheckMATE for detector simulation:

	./SetupDelphesCard.sh to replace orignal version in CheckMATE

SetupDelphesCards.sh only use Delphes/detector_cards/delphes_skimmed_ATLAS_13TeV.tcl for CheckMATE.

	Original cards attached with CheckMATE will be stored in $CHECKMATE_PATH/data/cards_original
