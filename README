1.  Needed package:

CalcHEP: Calcualte simplfied model at parton level
CheckMATE: Call PYTHIA and DELPHES threads from .lhe to .root results

Add
  export DELPHES_PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/DELPHES
  export CALCHEP_PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/CALCHEP
  export CHECKMATE_PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/CHECKMATE
in .bashrc

2.
//  Setup Analysis Working folder
  run ./SetupAnalysis.sh $AnalysisName

  Suggested way for $AnalysisName is "ModelName_AnalysisMethod_ExperimentCondition"
  SimplifiedDM_dijet_ATLAS13TeV
  SimplifiedDM_HHMET_VariableR_ATLAS13TeV
  ...

//   Plugging Variable-R jet algorithm

   run ./SetupVariableR.sh (Only once in the same repository, multiple analysis will share the same algorithm)

	1. VariableR_jet
	Plug VariableR algorithm package in Delphes, described as VariableR_jet/README

	2.JetAlgoModification

	Replace "FastJetFinder.cc" and "FastJetFinder.h" in $DELPHES/modules
        Original versions are stored in $DELPHES/modules/FastJetFinder_default

   In DELPHES:
   ./configure
   make -j10
   make install

   Variable-R jet algorithm has been added into Delphes and available in CheckMATE


//  Event generation with CalcHep 

Simplfied model files are attached in Simplified_Models/models
model15 and model16 are two simplified models which should be added into $CALCHEP/models

Setup_parton_generator.sh help to setup working folder for CalcHEP
Script for CalcHEP parameter scanning are collected in calchep_script
To run parton level simulation, it is necessary to add new models in working dictionary with ./calchepmanually. Batch mode generation is then available with CalcHEP scripts.


//  Detector simulation with CheckMATE
