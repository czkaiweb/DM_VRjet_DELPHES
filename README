1.  Needed package:

CalcHEP: Calcualte simplfied model at parton level
CheckMATE: Call PYTHIA and DELPHES threads from .lhe to .root results

Add
  export DELPHES_PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/DELPHES
  export CALCHEP_PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/CALCHEP
  export CHECKMATE_PATH=/PATH/TO/YOUR/CHECKMATE

for C shell, use "set" 
in .bashrc/.bash_profile

2.

  A. Setup Analysis Working folder

  SetupAnalysis.sh can create working folder for your event genaration and analysis
  run ./SetupAnalysis.sh $AnalysisName

  Suggested way for $AnalysisName is "ModelName_AnalysisMethod_ExperimentCondition"
  SimplifiedDM_dijet_ATLAS13TeV
  SimplifiedDM_HHMET_VariableR_ATLAS13TeV
  ...

  B. Plugging Variable-R jet algorithm

  run ./SetupVariableR.sh (Only once in the same repository, multiple analysis will share the same algorithm)

	1. VariableR_jet
	Plug VariableR algorithm package in Delphes, described as VariableR_jet/README

	2.JetAlgoModification

	Replace "FastJetFinder.cc" and "FastJetFinder.h" in $DELPHES/modules
        Original versions are stored in $DELPHES/modules/FastJetFinder_default

   In DELPHES:
   ./configure
   make -j10
   make install

   Variable-R jet algorithm has been added into Delphes and available in CheckMATE


  C.  Event generation with CalcHep 

  In the Analysis Working foler, 
  SetupCalcHEP.sh create CalcHEP working folder

  Simplfied model files are attached in Simplified_Models/models
  model15 and model16 are two simplified models which should be added into $CALCHEP/models

  Setup_parton_generator.sh help to setup working folder for CalcHEP
  Script for CalcHEP parameter scanning are collected in calchep_script
  To run parton level simulation, it is necessary to add new models in working dictionary with ./calchep manually. Batch mode generation is then available with CalcHEP scripts.


  D.  Detector simulation with CheckMATE
  
  SetupDelphesCard.sh plug needed delphes card to CheckMATE, User can build their own cards. For now, all cards will be seen as ATLAS_13TeV cards. 

  !! IMPORTANT: Every time delphes cards are updated, it will cause global change. It is strongly recommended that avoid runnning simualtions with different delphes cards in parallel.
